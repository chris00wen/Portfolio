# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Tools

*A collection of Jupyter notebooks & Python snippets for real-world data
exploration*

This repository contains practical tools, reusable code snippets, and
fully worked Jupyter notebooks for performing **Exploratory Data
Analysis (EDA)** --- the process of understanding, cleaning,
visualizing, and transforming datasets prior to modeling or deeper
analytics.

Whether you're preparing data for machine learning, investigating
trends, or exploring messy real-world datasets, these tools give you a
strong starting point.

## 📊 What Is EDA?

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is the step in the data workflow
where you: - Understand the dataset's structure - Examine distributions
& summary statistics - Identify missing or anomalous values - Explore
correlations & relationships - Visualize trends and patterns - Prepare
the data for modeling

This repo provides **practical, reusable** examples of how to do this
efficiently in Python.

## 📚 Included Notebooks & Snippets

### 📘 Notebooks

-   `data_cleanup.ipynb` --- column cleanup, label normalization
-   `eda_pandas.ipynb` --- Pandas calls to explore & describe dataset
-   `eda_ydata_profiling.ipynb` --- Ydata package to explore & analyze dataset


## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Launch Jupyter

``` bash
jupyter lab
```

### Open a Notebook

Browse into `/notebooks` and start with `eda_pandas.ipynb`.

## 🧠 Why This Exists

During real projects, EDA is where: - Insights emerge - Data issues are
found early - Better models are ultimately built
